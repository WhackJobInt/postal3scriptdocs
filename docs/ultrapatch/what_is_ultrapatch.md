# ðŸ†™ What is Postal III Ultrapatch?

[Postal III Ultrapatch](https://www.moddb.com/mods/postal-iii-ultrapatch) is a mod/patch released by **WhackJob Interactive** for Postal III.  

This patch addresses a significant number of bugs and crashes that were present in Postal III, and also includes additional improvements, changes, and restored cut content.  

The modifications are faithful to the current design of the game and were born out of the efforts of the [Catharsis Reborn](https://www.moddb.com/mods/catharsis-reborn) total conversion modding team. 

While some of the changes were initially intended for [Catharsis Reborn](https://www.moddb.com/mods/catharsis-reborn), the team decided to adapt them to the vanilla version of Postal III and further enhance the experience.
