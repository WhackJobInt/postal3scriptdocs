# Jen Walcott's Bodyguard (ai_mission_jwb.p3s)
<h1>Pre-Path</h1>

If only the Taser wasn't that bad... maybe this mission wouldn't feel frustrating.  
How is it that Jen can kill people with her shovel, but you cannot?

<p>JWB does not have unused behaviors.
<p>All behavior names used in the level:
<pre><code class="language-js">
'bh_mall_mom_prespawn' -- is in script file
'bh_mis_jen' -- is in script file, mission logic
'bh_shovel' -- Used by Jens shovel
'bh_jwb_civil' -- is in script file
'bh_cellphone'
'bh_jwb_civil_static' -- is in script file
'bh_jen_cop' -- is in script file, used by Cops
'bh_jwb_jen' -- is in script file, used by Jen
'bh_mall_mom' -- is in script file
</code></pre>
<p>JWB has very subtle commented out lines that it is hard to say confidentally what things were heavily changed, or cut.
