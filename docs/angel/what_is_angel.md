# ðŸª½ What is Postal III Ultrapatch Angel?

[Postal III Ultrapatch Angel](https://www.moddb.com/mods/postal-iii-ultrapatch) is a mod released by **WhackJob Interactive** which is built on top of Ultrapatch.  

Angel implements the [AngelScript](https://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/) scripting language on top of Postal III's own scripting language *Postal3Script*.  

It allows modders to create complex and fast execution code inside Postal3Script, and greatly manipulate the game using the available functions and classes. *(over 500+ if also counting methods)*

Originally Postal III Angel was a mod that implemented the AngelScript scripting language *only*, but now it has it's own unique features, like *Multiplayer support*.

!!! note Note
	- Angel-only features on the docs are marked with the ðŸª½ emoji.
	- ðŸ†™Ultrapatch features will work on ðŸª½Angel, but not vice-versa.
	- Not to be confused with old version of Angel (Postal 3 Angel, pre-Ultrapatch)
